ii. Detail which requirements you have completed, which are incomplete, and which
are buggy (be specific)

Opening Menu
The buttons were chosen because they fit the "Hell" opening scene in the main menu. It gives a distinct fiery and intense feel to the game. The font was also chosen because we wanted the font to be more blockish to appeal to an arcade-fighting type of game such as Tekken.

Credits

Particle Systems for the following:

Any special instructions: Use keyboard left and right as well as a joystick left/right to navigate the menu. Enter on the keyboard as well as the default action button on the joystick. Particle Systems ....
