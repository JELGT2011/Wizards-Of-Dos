-----Input Reassignment for characters-----


Both the paladin and ninja characters can be set to use controller or keyboard now.
To switch select the character in the hierarchy and look for the Player Assign field.

Type K2 for keyboard 2 Input mappings

Type J1 for Controller 1 Input mappings

Type J2 for Controller 2 Input mappings

You can assign the characters different input types. This allows one character to use
a keyboard and the other a controller. Of course two controllers at once works too. 

If you assign one character for keyboard and the other for a controller make sure you 
assign the keyboard character with K1 and the controller character with J1. Unity automatically 
assigns the controllers a corresponding Joystick number that matches according to the order the
controller was plugged in. Joystick 1 is assigned to the first controller plugged in and Joystick 2 
is assigned to the second.
