ii. Detail which requirements you have completed, which are incomplete, and which
are buggy (be specific)

We have implemented a PvP 2 person fighting game; one person vs another. We have 4 characters to choose from with 3 attacks each (Maria, Ninja, Masked Torra, and Ekko) and we have 4 stages to choose from (Ice, Hell, Jungle, and Japan). Characters have standard movement with a dodge and jump, along with their respective rag dolls when they die. Each stage has different characteristics and embellishments, including background music, sound,   weather, and different particle effects. 

You and another player should battle it out on a chosen stage to the death.

Some terrains are helpful and offer bonuses that help your health; i.e. the Japanese terrain has ice cream and hamburgers that give you bonus health. Other terrains have AI that is harmful, like the ice terrain which has spiders that will attack and seek out players. In the Swamp, the weeds will cause users to have extra damage, while the tree in the center that once in a while offers a protection for players. In the Hell, platforms may drop or rise, causing unexpected fun for the fight.
