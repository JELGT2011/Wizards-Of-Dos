ii. Detail which requirements you have completed, which are incomplete, and which
are buggy (be specific)

We have implemented a PvP 2 person fighting game; one person vs another. We have 4 characters to choose from with 3 attacks each (Maria, Ninja, Masked Torra, and Ekko) and we have 4 stages to choose from (Ice, Hell, Jungle, and Japan).

You and another player should battle it out on a chosen stage to the death. 

Some terrains are helpful and offer bonuses that help your health; in the japanese terrain. Other terrains have AI that is harmful.
